# IoT-Coolant-Monitoring-for-Lathe-Machine
Analysis of Materials and Information Flows  learns about the integration of material flow (conversion of raw materials into products), information flow (planning and control of production), and cost flow in order to support the effective manufacturing.

This repository is an individual final project for the Material and Information Flow Analysis course. I made a hardware prototype called Cool-It in the form of an IoT-Based Integrated Coolant Monitoring System and Real-Time Data for Lathes using a turbidity sensor. Coolant plays an important role in the turning process because it has benefits, one of which is to extend the life of the tool. However, the problem is that operators often do not know exactly when to replace the coolant. Therefore, I set up this project to know when to change the coolant based on the measured turbidity level.

In this project, I made a 3D design which was then realized using cardboard material. Apart from that, the software that I use includes:
1. Arduino IDE = to program the Arduino UNO microcontroller that I use
2. MySQL = to record changes in coolant turbidity per second as a real-time database
3. Framework Node-Red = as a link for data recorded by sensors with the database
4. Tinkercad = to design electrical circuits
5. Solidworks 2019 = to design Cool-It
6. Draw.io = to create a system workflow
